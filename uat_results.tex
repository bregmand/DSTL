\subsection{Universal adversarial training}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Using EMNIST data set \cite{EMNIST_data}.
		\item Programmed using Pytouch (find out how to cite).
		\item Trained 3 models, Vanila training, Universal adversarial training (Shafahi et al \cite{shafahi_universal_2018}), and training with an attacking AI.
		\item Tested accuracy against 2 attacks FGSM and Universal adversarial attack.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Code description
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Explain network architecture.
		\item Explain variables within the system.
		\item Explain choice of variables for testing, highlight arbitariness of them.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Results of model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Include two main plots and comment about the implications of these.
		\item Discus idea about genetic algorithm.
	\end{itemize}
